## Problem it Solves

List making, note taking reminders and scribbles are common with a lot of people. Whilst just another list/task tracking app is an ok idea, a gamified version just adds a modern day fun spin on a standard task tracker.

## Initial Idea

Everyday Task Tracker with a gamified twist. When the need for keeping task lists is present, however earning points is extra incentive for completion. 

## Description

Taskio is your task tracking friend with a kick of motivation of earning points!
